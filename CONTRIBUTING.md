# Contributing
0. Find an improvement or an issue
1. Fork the repo
2. Work on your code
3. Send pull request

Notes:

  Pull requests should have at MOST two commits. Optional first commit can have specs, or specs and code can be in a single commit.
  This is to avoid polluting the commit history with superflous history and comments.
